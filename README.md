## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.56+ (with nightly features for async)
- Cargo and standard Rust toolchain

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-protocols.git
cd quantum-protocols

```

### Quick Start

```rust
use quantum_protocols::core::QuantumState;
use quantum_protocols::security::qrng::QRNG;
use quantum_protocols::integration::protocol_bridge::QuantumProtocolBridge;

// Create a quantum random number generator
let mut qrng = QRNG::new_default();
let random_bytes = qrng.generate_bytes(32).unwrap();
println!("Generated quantum random bytes: {:?}", random_bytes);

// Create a quantum state with 3 qubits
let state = QuantumState::new(3);
println!("Created quantum state with fidelity: {}", state.fidelity());

// Initialize a protocol bridge for integrated operations
let bridge = QuantumProtocolBridge::new();
```

## Core Components

### Quantum State & Qubit Management

The core of the system is built on quantum state simulation:

- **QuantumState** - Represents a complete quantum state that can be transferred or stored
- **QuantumRegister** - Manages multiple qubits as a cohesive register
- **Qubit** - Fundamental quantum bit implementation with superposition and entanglement simulation

These core components provide the foundation for all quantum protocols in the ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Module Organization

The project is organized into the following main modules:

```
src/
├── core/            # Core quantum state and qubit implementations
├── error_correction/ # Error correction and fault tolerance protocols
├── security/        # Security and cryptography protocols
├── consensus/       # Consensus and distributed system protocols
├── network/         # Network and communication protocols
├── integration/     # Integration and bridging components
└── util/            # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Adapter Pattern

The library implements the adapter design pattern to bridge components with incompatible interfaces:

- `QESPNetworkAdapter`: Connects `NetworkTopology` (using direct `Node` references) with `QESP` (using `Arc<RwLock<Node>>`)
- `ProtocolBridge`: Provides a unified interface to all quantum protocols
- Enables seamless integration between different protocol implementations
- Provides unified API for operations across architectural boundaries
- Maintains separation of concerns for better maintainability

### Quantum Simulation Approach

All quantum effects are simulated with high fidelity to prepare for eventual execution on real quantum hardware:

- Superposition is modeled using probability amplitudes
- Entanglement is tracked between related qubits
- Decoherence is simulated based on time and environmental factors
- Measurements collapse superpositions following quantum mechanical principles
- Quantum gates are implemented with appropriate transformations
