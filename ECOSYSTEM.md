1. **Initialize the Protocol Bridge**:
```rust
let bridge = QuantumProtocolBridge::new();
```

2. **Generate Quantum Random Numbers**:
```rust
let mut qrng = bridge.qrng_mut();
let random_bytes = qrng.generate_bytes(32)?;
```

3. **Create a Quantum State**:

- **Phase Damping**: Models phase decoherence (T2 dephasing) with accurate time constants (typical T2 ~20-50 μs).
- **Depolarizing Noise**: Implements random Pauli errors that occur in real quantum systems.

### Quantum Communication Simulation

- **Fiber Optic Loss**: Models standard telecom fiber loss rates (0.2 dB/km) for realistic entanglement fidelity calculations.
- **Detector Efficiency**: Simulates typical SNSPD (Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector) efficiency (~85%).

### Hardware-Inspired Parameters

All simulation parameters are derived from current quantum hardware specifications:

- Gate fidelities matching real quantum processors
- Communication channels modeled after experimental quantum networks
- Error rates aligned with published quantum hardware benchmarks

This approach ensures that protocols developed in this ecosystem will transition smoothly to real quantum hardware as it becomes more widely available.
